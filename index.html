                    <h1>Biography of Joy K Mathew </h1><br>


<div class="col-md-12">                       <p>
Joy K Mathew is the son of former Indian Army man, KJ Mathew and Mary Mathew. From the very childhood days, he had a profound love for watching movies, hearing stories, reading and writing. His main hobby during child hood was to turn short stories into dramas, write skits and perform it with friends on stages. 

 </p>
<p>By the time he completed his 10th, he found himself having an ardent love for movies and wanted to turn his career into it, but the parents were opposed to Joy's wish. After completing the service in army, his father started working abroad. Parents decided to send joy to pursue electrical / electronic Engineering with the purpose of taking Joy abroad with his father. With the deep desire for film in mind, Joy started his studies, obeying the parents. After completing Engineering, father took joy abroad. 
</p>

                  <p>Even though in overseas, love for film was stronger in Joy’s mind. Even in the midst of his job in abroad, he did not limit himself with the thoughts on film and related activities but also started to get himself involved in charity and social activities. In order to make his burning film desire come true, he tried getting closer to film industry and made new friendships. Within a few years, leaving his foreign job, he returned to India with the thought of making his own signature in the film. Although more actively involved in making new friendships in film industry and social activities, he often got saddened by the thought that he might have to go back abroad. 
 </p>
				                    <p>
Mother Teresa, the mother of the poor was the guiding light behind Joy’s way to social service and philanthropy. The self-sacrificing life of Mother Teresa influenced, powered and contributed to the social views of Joy. Knowing the sad news, Mother Teresa had fallen ill, Joy tried to meet her in person. Although the way realise the wish had full of challenges, the efforts were not futile. Around one and a half month, Joy stayed in Kolkata-India with the aim of seeing Mother Teresa at least once. During this time, he could visit all the ministry centres built by Mother Teresa in Kolkata. He also spent time helping the poor and the sick there in those centres. And, on a blessed day, he got the golden and rare opportunity to meet Mother for which he was eagerly waiting for. This took him into a state of cloud nine. He still remembers the day as it has just happened yesterday. He could reveal and share all his thoughts and wishes to Mother, opening up his mind and heart. 
</p>
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  
				  <p>
				  
				  “I would like to spread Motivational messages in the society using the medium of film, but I do not know whether I will be successful or not”, Joy said to mother. Mother replied, “go ahead courageously, my prayers are always with you”. Mother saw him off with her blessings and giving many gifts. 
</p><p>
Memories of this unique moment in life and the confidence that the presence of Mother is still with him is the source of energy for Joy's work today. After returning from Kolkata, with the blessings of Mother Teresa, Joy started World Mother Vision, a motivational film production movement. A few months after his return from Kolkata, Mother Teresa was called for her eternal gift on September 5, 1997. Although the departure of Mother put Joy in agony, the insight that the presence of Mother is with him gave him the courage to go ahead. Since 1997, Joy Started producing and screening Motivational films under the banner of World Mother Vision with the aim of the progress of the society and to motivate people.  Joy released 11 Motivational films and 3 documentaries which had three minutes to 2 hours of time duration. Joy’s films and documentaries grabbed several national and international awards and recognitions.
</p><p>
Joy got married in 1999 and has two daughters. The names given to them was of Mother Teresa, the energy, power and guiding light of Joy. He named them Agnes and Teresa. Joy’s family moved to Australia in 2008. Joy continued his passion of producing motivational films in Australia too. In 2019, with the support of Queen's Land Government, Banana Shire Council and Radf Fund, he released The Dependence, a motivational film in English. The film received the recognition of Government of Queen's Land, Radf Fund and Banana Shire Council. 
</p><p>
Joy is raising his daughters, providing awareness of the importance and need of the charity and social activities from their very child hood. The world has become a global village. The evidence of it is that in all countries there are people of different nationalities, religions and cultures. The leaders of the governments divide the citizens and sow the seeds of hatred among them to gain political advantage.  Today, the boundaries of many countries are bound by the human rights violations created by government to keep the power unquestionably. Joy taught and trained his daughters to demonstrate the outstanding examples of humanity, cooperation, and love to break these human made boundaries with hidden agendas.  Both of his daughters have grown in understanding the value of equality, fraternity, and coexistence through the lessons learned from their father. 
</p><p>
Joy tells us through his life and her children that nothing is impossible and can achieve and learn anything through hard work and by trying constantly. For Joy it is very saddening that mental health has become worst in the world and needs best care.  Another objective of Joy is to create a younger generation of good mental health by giving them best mental care possible. Joy is trying to encourage his daughters to bring back those who suffer from mental health problem to the mainstream of societies by extending creative awareness, training and related activities in many places of the world. 
</p><p>
Joy reveals his presence to the world by becoming the light in the darkness and hope for the teary eyes with the great prayer and verse, ‘sacrificing self-satisfaction, one should focus on wellbeing of others’.  Joy, who only aims to use and dedicate his own life for the good of others, do not mourn for anything that he wants to do, if it doesn’t happen in time due to various difficulties. He believes that the things will happen at the right time in the right mode without any difficulties if one deserves it. He also desires for only the things that he deserves and move only through the right path.

<p>                            This is his famous motivational film, which got many international acclaims. The importance of eye donation in a human life is the subject of this film and encourages the public to donate their organs. The presence of Mr. Joy K. Mathew and some other celebrities made the film more popular and success.  Mr. Kochouseph Chittilappally, the famous industrialist who donated one of his kidneys, handled the main roles in this short film.
</p><p>Kochouseph Chittilappally, who has shown love for humanity by donating   one of his kidneys to a stranger, is a milestone in humanitarian work. We hear about more and more parents donating their children's organs- those who have undergone brain deaths- and people who donate their eyes on death. This is because people like Chittilappally exist like an oasis in the desert of humanity- where mostly we have chasms devoid of emotion or selflessness. People like him handles a major role in inspiring others and spreading the feelings to do the same like him.
</p><p>Since time immemorial, perhaps from the beginning of mankind, man had the urge to gain immortality. From elixir to unicorn blood in mythologies, he has experimented to find out the secret behind immortality. But now, the path to immortality is open. We can triumph over mortality by donating organs and thus live on. Let us be ready to take the decision- that we will donate our organs. Joy K. Mathew, who got innumerable awards and recognitions for his insightful, classic films, is showing us the greatness of donating organs through his movie 'Mortality' under the banner of World Mother Vision. 
</p><p>In the presence of the State M.L.A. Adv. A.M. Arif, Indian Film Actress Kaviyoor Ponnamma ,KochousephC hittilappally, World Table Tennis Star Maria Roni and Joy K. Mathew, this movie conquered great heights with its beautiful aims to enlighten the society.

<p>                            	This is a well noted documentary. Parvathy Puthanar is a river in the capital city of Kerala called Thiruvananthapuram. People living on the banks of this river were not much aware of the importance of the healthy existence of this river. They always dumped their domestic waste into the river. This created many environmental issues in the surrounding area. Now Parvathi Puthanar is one of the main environmental challenges in Thiruvananthapuram. 
</p><p>The documentary narrates the environmental problems in the society. It also convinces the society about the importance of protecting the river.

<span class="h3 spaceontop">About Mother Teresa<br>

</span><br>
<p>Saint Mother Teresa (26 August 1910 to 5 September 1997) also known as Blessed Teresa of Calcutta, was a Roman Catholic religious sister and missionary. She was born in Skopje (modern Republic of Macedonia). After having lived in Macedonia for some eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived her life till the last breath.
Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, now known as Mother Teresa, was the third and final child born to her Albanian Catholic parents, Nikollë and Dranafile Bojaxhiu, in the city of Skopje (a predominantly Muslim city in the Balkans). Her father was an entrepreneur and who worked as a construction contractor and a trader of medicines and other goods. When Mother Teresa was about eight years old, her father died unexpectedly. Agnes attended a convent and primary school and a secondary school.
When Mother Teresa was 12 years old, she began to feel called to serve God as a nun. In 1928, 18-year-old Mother Teresa travelled to Ireland and then on to India and never saw her mother or sister again. It took more than two years to become a Loreto nun. After spending six weeks in Ireland Mother Teresa then travelled to India in 1929. After two years as a novice, Mother Teresa took her first vows as a Loreto nun on May 24, 1931.
As a new Loreto nun, Mother Teresa (known then only as Sister Teresa, a name she chose after St. Teresa of Lisieux) settled in to the Loreto Entally convent in Kolkata (previously called Calcutta) and began teaching history and geography at the convent schools. In 1935, 25-year-old Mother Teresa was given a special exemption to teach at a school outside of the convent, St. Teresa's. After two years at St. Teresa's, Mother Teresa took her final vows on 24 May 1937 and officially became "Mother Teresa."
</p>
<p>Almost immediately after taking her final vows, Mother Teresa became the principal of St. Mary's, one of the convent schools and was once again restricted to live within the convent's walls.
</p>
<p>"A call within a call"
September 10, 1946, a day now annually celebrated as "Inspiration Day," Mother Teresa received what she described as a "call within a call." She had been traveling on a train to Darjeeling when she received an "inspiration," a message that told her to leave the convent and help the poor by living among them.
Mother Teresa was granted permission to leave the convent for one year to help the poorest of the poor.
</p><p>In March 1949, Mother Teresa was joined by her first helper, a former pupil from Loreto. Soon she had ten former pupils helping her.
</p><p>At the end of Mother Teresa's pro visionary year, she petitioned to form her own order of nuns, the Missionaries of Charity. Her request was granted by Pope Pius XII; the Missionaries of Charity was established on 7 October 1950.
